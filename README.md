# Applications of AI for Anomaly Detection

This repository contains code for detecting anomalies using AI-based models. The main focus is on identifying potential security threats through data analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview

This project leverages AI techniques to analyze data for anomalies that might indicate security threats. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, and generating visual reports to assist security teams.

### Features
- Data preprocessing to clean and organize raw data.
- Model training for anomaly detection.
- Dashboard and report generation for visual insights into threat patterns.

## File Structure

- `Applications-of-AI-for-Anomaly-Detection.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook for running and visualizing the anomaly detection models.
- `preprocess_data.py`: Python script for preprocessing the raw data.
- `data/`: Directory for storing data files (note: large files are not included in this repository so we will give you a link of a drive which has the data).
